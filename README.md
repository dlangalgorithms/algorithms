>[!NOTE]
> This repository is designed for beginners who want to get acquainted with the D language, but it can be useful for professionals as well.

The repository contains a lot of algorithms, 
from the simplest to the most complex. 

Here you can find everything from bubble sort 
to a compiler for your own language.

If you want, you can contribute to the project. 

Even if you are new to D, but can write simple algorithms, 
you can find an interesting algorithm, implement it and add it here!
